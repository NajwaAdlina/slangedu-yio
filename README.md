Hi, I'm Najwa Adlina, a fresh graduate majoring in English Language and Culture at Al Azhar University Indonesia. 
This is an app that I developed myself called “SlangEd-Yio,” which stands for Slang Education with Yio. This app is designed to help people learn and understand English slang more deeply.

This file is not for public use as it is a personal product for my thesis work.
